## In this tutorial, you will install CSF on Ubuntu 20.04. CSF is basically ConfigServer Security and Firewall, a popular security tool.

Introduction
Before we begin talking about how to install CSF on Ubuntu 20.04, letâ€™s briefly understand - What is CSF?

CSF is a ConfigServer Security and Firewall. It is a popular security tool for Linux. Further, it provides a simple-interface for the iptables to protect the Linux servers. The CSF has multiple features like stateful packet inspection firewall, intrusion-detection, a login-failure daemon, DDOS-protection, and control-panel integration.

In this tutorial, you will install CSF. We will also answer some FAQs relating to CSF installation.

### Step 1 - Deploying the Ubuntu Server
1) Deploy the new Ubuntu 20.04 instance.

2) Connect to the server through SSH as root.

### Step 2 - Preparing for the CSF Installation
1) Ubuntu 20.04 comes with the UFW firewall by default. You must remove it before installing CSF using the following command:

```
 apt remove ufw
```

2) Next, install the CSF dependencies.

apt install perl zip unzip libwww-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl
3) The CSF needs Send-mail to send alerts to the administrator.

```
apt install sendmail-bin
```

### Step 3 - Installing the CSF
1) Now, you should navigate to /usr/src.

```
cd /usr/src
```

2) Download the CSF distribution, by using the following command:

```
wget https://download.configserver.com/csf.tgz
```

3) Next extract the CSF.

```
tar -xzf csf.tgz
```

4) Then, navigate to /usr/src/csf.

```
cd csf
```
5) After that, eun the following command:

```
sh install.sh
```
6) Verify necessary iptables modules for the CSF are available.

```
perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl
```
7) Now, confirm that all tests report OK. You will notice the below result:

RESULT: csf should function on this server
8) Then, verify CSF status after the installation:

```
csf -v
```

9) You will see the below results:

```
csf: v14.02 (generic)
```

*WARNING* TESTING mode is enabled - do not forget to disable it in the configuration

### Step 4 - Configuring the CSF

1) The CSF runs in the TESTING mode by-default. Next, you need to edit /etc/csf/csf.conf to disable the TESTING mode.

```
nano /etc/csf/csf.conf
```

2) Now, locate the line TESTING = 1. Now, change the value to 0.

```
TESTING = "0"
```

3) You will then locate the line RESTRICT_SYSLOG = 0 and change the value to 3, that means only members of the RESTRICT_SYSLOG_GROUP may access the syslog/rsyslog files. Do it using the following command:

```
RESTRICT_SYSLOG = "3"
```

4) Now, save the configuration file.

5) You will stop and reload the CSF with -ra option:

```
csf -ra
```

Allow all access of all ports

```
vi /etc/csf/csf.allow
```
